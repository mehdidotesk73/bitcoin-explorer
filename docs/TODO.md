# Forecast tab — TODO

## Done

- [x] Interactive cycle-peak editor: move peak dates with sliders, add/remove a
      peak, clear all, and redistribute to the default tops.
- [x] Envelope band on the Price tab: shaded cone between the value baseline
      (`modelMa`) and the envelope-lifted ceiling (`modelMa × envelope`).
- [x] Restructure the price-mechanics input panel: a distinct "Calibration"
      section for the fitting knobs that overwrite the params (MA window, fit
      window, day zero, recency weighting γ, Reset to fit), separated from the
      hand-tunable model-parameter sections, with clearer labels.
- [x] Clearer model-selection naming (display labels only; underlying type
      values unchanged):
  - "Envelope" → "Volatility projection"; options → "Time-based exponential
    decay", "Value-based power decay", "Value-based exponential decay",
    "Constant".
  - "Value growth" → "Growth projection"; options → "Time-based power-law",
    "Time-based exponential", "Time-based linear".
  - "Peaks" → "Cycle peaks"; the kernel is `e^(−spread·|x−dᵢ|)` (double
    exponential), so the option is labelled "Laplacian" / "None".
  - "Horizon" left as-is (already clear).

- [x] Linear slope as an Nth-percentile trailing slope. Replaced the fixed
      min/median/mean/max variant with a `percentile()` helper + three params on
      `fitParams`: `slopeRangeDays` (how far back to gather samples),
      `slopeWindowDays` (span each slope is measured over — daily/weekly/
      monthly/yearly preset), and `slopePercentile` (0–100); dropped the
      `SlopeVariant`/`slopeStats` API. UI: "Slope range (days)", "Slope window"
      preset, and "Slope percentile" inputs in the Calibration section.

- [x] M/W price-heat indicator (Price Explorer). Colours the price by how it
      oscillates around its moving average: a smoothed (price−MA)/MA oscillator
      is cross-correlated against an idealised W/M template, giving a signed
      heat in [−1, +1]. Blue = W-bottom (two dips below the MA, bullish), red =
      M-top (two pushes above, bearish), neutral on flat/choppy stretches.
      Rendered as per-point coloured scatter dots over a faint price line
      (visualMap/line-segment colouring don't bind on a category axis), with a
      "M/W heat" toggle and an explainer tooltip.

- [x] **Heat-band DCA exploration** (Price Explorer). Buy only on days whose
      M/W heat falls in a band [centre ± window] (no fixed schedule — the band
      defines buy-days). Effectiveness = average ROI over *every* possible start
      day: from each start, split the budget equally across the buy-days to
      today, so ROI(s) = mean of (lastPrice/price[j]) − 1; average over all s
      to remove start-date luck. Compares the band plan vs buy-every-day.
      `dcaBandExplore()` / `avgStartRoi()` in `indicators.ts`; UI controls are
      buy-band centre + window sliders.

## Next branch

- [ ] Stretch from the DCA work: forward-return analysis conditioned on heat at
      entry (avg N-day return after deep-blue vs neutral vs deep-red) to measure
      the signal's correlation directly rather than via the DCA proxy.

## Housekeeping / ideas

- [ ] Add a CI build + type-check gate on PRs (a broken-build commit reached
      history on the forecast-tab branch because nothing ran `npm run build`).
