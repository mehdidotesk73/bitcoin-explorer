# Forecast tab — TODO

## Done

- [x] Interactive cycle-peak editor: move peak dates with sliders, add/remove a
      peak, clear all, and redistribute to the default tops.
- [x] Envelope band on the Price tab: shaded cone between the value baseline
      (`modelMa`) and the envelope-lifted ceiling (`modelMa × envelope`).
- [x] Restructure the price-mechanics input panel: a distinct "Calibration"
      section for the fitting knobs that overwrite the params (MA window, fit
      window, day zero, recency weighting γ, Reset to fit), separated from the
      hand-tunable model-parameter sections, with clearer labels.
- [x] Clearer model-selection naming (display labels only; underlying type
      values unchanged):
  - "Envelope" → "Volatility projection"; options → "Time-based exponential
    decay", "Value-based power decay", "Value-based exponential decay",
    "Constant".
  - "Value growth" → "Growth projection"; options → "Time-based power-law",
    "Time-based exponential", "Time-based linear".
  - "Peaks" → "Cycle peaks"; the kernel is `e^(−spread·|x−dᵢ|)` (double
    exponential), so the option is labelled "Laplacian" / "None".
  - "Horizon" left as-is (already clear).

- [x] Linear slope as nth-percentile over a past D-day window. Replaced the
      fixed min/median/mean/max variant with a `percentile()` helper +
      `slopeWindowDays` / `slopePercentile` params on `fitParams`; dropped the
      `SlopeVariant`/`slopeStats` API. UI: "Slope percentile" (0–100) and
      "Slope lookback (days, 0 = all)" inputs in the Calibration section.

## Next branch

(nothing queued yet)

## Housekeeping / ideas

- [ ] Add a CI build + type-check gate on PRs (a broken-build commit reached
      history on the forecast-tab branch because nothing ran `npm run build`).
